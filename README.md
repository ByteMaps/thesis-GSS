Welcome to the repository that holds my thesis bachelor model! The model simulates Opinion Dynamics through 
Agent-Based Modelling (hence the name of the root directory) with the base model remixed from Weinans et al. (2024) "An exploration of Drivers of Opinion Dynamics".

My thesis revolves about Generational Turnover, or the influence on dynamic agent removal and addition over time and it's effect on OD.
