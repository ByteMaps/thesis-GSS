Welcome to the repository that holds my thesis bachelor model! 

## Abstract
This thesis investigates how generational turnover influences societal opinion dynamics using
an Agent-Based Model. By extending an existing opinion dynamics model with stochastic agent
replacement, this study explores how turnover impacts the emergence of consensus, coexistence, or
polarisation. The results reveal that turnover increases the probability of coexistence and hinders
consensus formation, offering insights for both modelling and policy design in dynamic social
systems. Some of the main findings of this research are the increased probability of coexistence
states and absence of consensus states, the increased stable model runtime, and the rise and drop
of the average Degree over the turnover interval. Given the relevance of the field in sustainability,
research to dissect stochastic factors and consensus drivers is needed.

My work is based on the framework as laid out by Els Weinans et al. (2024) *An Exploration of Drivers of Opinion Dynamics*.
